# Foo PIN Entry

First of all: **DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM!** It's probably horribly insecure and
broken.

But, since [pinentry-mac](https://github.com/GPGTools/pinentry-mac) stopped
working after the latest MacOS update, I had to come up with a solution fast.
Which is this pile of Javascript spaghetti code.

For further information about the underlying protocl, see the [pinentry protocol description](http://info2html.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/info2html-demo/info2html?(pinentry)Protocol) and [assuan manual](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/assuan/).
